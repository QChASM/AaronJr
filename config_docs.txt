[DEFAULT]
For creating workflow metadata and specifying default options to be used in other sections

Options:
    user = <username>
    project = <project name>
	name = <config name>
	top_dir = <path to top dir> (defaults to location of config file)
	remote_dir = <path to remote work location>
    <key> = <value>
        <value> is the default setting for the <key> option in all sections


[Configs]
for including workflows from children configuration files

Options:
    <key> = <value>
    Description:
        <key> is the NAME used in [Results] and [Plot]
        <value> is a comma-separated list of paths to configuration files describing jobs to associate with <key>

    override:
        <key> = <new_value>
    Description:
        override the value for <key> in [DEFAULT] section of child configurations with <new_value>


[Results]
For parsing and calculating results

Special values:
    FUNCTION
        simple arithmetic that may include variables using JOBSPEC
    JOBSPEC
        filter by name only:
            NAME
        filter by name and template:
            NAME{TEMPLATE}
        filter by name and change:
            NAME:CHANGE
        filter by name, template, and change:
            NAME{TEMPLATE}:CHANGE

        NAME
            the name defined in [Config] section
        TEMPLATE
            the name of a template file used (without file extension)
        CHANGE
            the name of the change defined in [Substitution] or [Mapping] sections
            (or defined using the `group` option in [Results] section)
            to indicate the template structure without modifications, use "none"

Options:
    relative = FUNCTION
    Description:
        define the relative value to use when displaying output

    <key> = FUNCTION
    Description:
        add data entry for <key> as defined in FUNCTION

    group:
        <change> = <value list>
    Description:
        <change> is the new change name used in JOBSPEC and for visually grouping output
        <value list> is a comma-separated list of CHANGEs to group as as <change>

    hide = <value list>
    Description:
        hide the output of jobs in output printing
        <value list> is a comma-separated list of JOBSPECs

[Plot]
xlim = min max
ylim = min max
path:
	JOBSPEC [name]
	JOBSPEC [*-name]   # * is selectivity wildcard, eg: R-name, S-name, etc.
	...

[Reaction]
reaction = <reaction name>
template = <template name
selectivity = <selectivity list>
        
[Geometry]
structure = <filename> or <SMILES>
constraints = comma-separated list of (atom indices)
call <function name> = comma-separated list of (*args, **kwargs)
&call =
	structure.<function name>(*args, **kwargs)
	structure.<function name>(*args, **kwargs)
	...

[Job]
type = <job type>
charge = int(charge)
multiplicity = int(multiplicity)
method = <method name>
basis = <basis spec>
ecp = <basis spec>
solvent = <solvent name>
solvent_model = <model name>
GAUSSIAN_ROUTE = {"key": ["val"]}

Notes:
	<basis spec>:
		basis    -> applies basis to all atoms
		X basis	 -> applies basis to all X atoms
		!X basis -> applies basis to all atoms except X
	available <job type>:
		optimize or opt
		optimize.changes
		optimize.constrained
		optimize.ts
		frequencies or freq
		single-point or SP
		conformers
		conformers.constrained
		

[HPC]
ppn = int(number of cores)

[Substitution]
reopt = BOOL
<atom indices> = <new substituent>
<name>:
	<atom indices> = <new substituent>
	<atom indices> = <new substituent>
	...
&combinations:
	<atom indices> = <substituent list>
	<atom indices> = <substituent list>
	...
Allowed substituent forms:
	{SMILES} with X in place of sub.end eg: {XOH} adds alcohol group, {X=NH} adds imine
	Aaron_Libs name
	"None" will simply remove the fragment without adding a new substituent
